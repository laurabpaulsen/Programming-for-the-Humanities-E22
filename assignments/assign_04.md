# Assignment 4: Data Visualization #

In this assignment you have to use your knowledge of modular programming and visualization in Python. The assignment consists of four problems and you have to solve a minumum of three (feel free to solve all four). For problems 1-3 you should use the series data set available [here](https://github.com/CHCAA-EDUX/Programming-for-the-Humanities-E22/tree/main/dat/series). FOr problem 4 use the World Happiness Survey 2021 [here](https://github.com/CHCAA-EDUX/Programming-for-the-Humanities-E22/blob/main/dat/world-happiness-report-2021.dat). By default, the assignments assume that you use `matplotlib`, but if you prefer to use another library that is a fully acceptable solution.


## 1. Custom Plotting Function ##

Write a function that can take a (time) series and a filename as input and generates a series visualization that is stored under the filename.

## 2. Modify Figure Properties ##

Modify the color and linewidth of the series visualization generated by custom plotting function of problem 1. Further more, add a title to the visualization and labels on the x and y axis. Make these parameters customizable in the custom plotting function.

Visit the [Pyplot tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html) for information on figure properties.

## 3. To Stack or not to Stack ##

In this problem you have to make two plots from at least eight series objects (rows) in one data file, e.g., [series-01.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHCAA-EDUX/Programming-for-the-Humanities-E21/main/dat/series/series-01.csv). In the first plot, you have to stack the eight series in one plot, that is, they shold all be in the same plot window (i.e., stacked on top of each other). In the second plot, each series object should have its own subplot (i.e., a total of eight 'unstacked' subplots). Discuss the advantage/disadvantage of stacked vs unstacked plotting of series data.


## 4. Pair Plot of World Happiness Survey ##

Read the following columns from `world-happiness-report-2021.dat` [here](https://github.com/CHCAA-EDUX/Programming-for-the-Humanities-E22/blob/main/dat/world-happiness-report-2021.dat) into a `pandas` dataframe: 

* _Regional indicator_
* _Ladder score_
* _Logged GDP per capita_
* _Healthy life expectancy_
* _Freedom to make life choices_
* _Generosity_
* _Perceptions of corruption_

Extract the data for two regions using the _Regional indicator_  column from the dataframe and create a `pairplot` using `seaborn` that compares the two regions. You can choose any two regions you like, but the resulting plot should look similar to this:
